# Distros to consider
- Helm (https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/). Doesn't seem that useful on its own, but may be a dependency for other useful things
- Centaur Emacs (https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d). It looks nice, but I am hesitant to install something that has a lot of stuff I don't really understand.

# Smaller packages to consider
- corfu - completion overlay
- flymake - would be useful if it did on-the-fly python syntax checking
